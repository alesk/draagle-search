  <!-- SearchHandler

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SearchHandler

       For processing Search Queries, the primary Request Handler
       provided with Solr is "SearchHandler" It delegates to a sequent
       of SearchComponents (see below) and supports distributed
       queries across multiple shards
    -->
  <requestHandler name="/select" class="solr.SearchHandler">
    <!-- default values for query parameters can be specified, these
         will be overridden by parameters in the request
      -->
     <lst name="defaults">
       <str name="echoParams">explicit</str>
       <int name="rows">10</int>
       <str name="df">name</str>
       <str name="wt">json</str>
     </lst>
    <!-- In addition to defaults, "appends" params can be specified
         to identify values which should be appended to the list of
         multi-val params from the query (or the existing "defaults").
      -->
    <!-- In this example, the param "fq=instock:true" would be appended to
         any query time fq params the user may specify, as a mechanism for
         partitioning the index, independent of any user selected filtering
         that may also be desired (perhaps as a result of faceted searching).

         NOTE: there is *absolutely* nothing a client can do to prevent these
         "appends" values from being used, so don't use this mechanism
         unless you are sure you always want it.
      -->
    <!--
       <lst name="appends">
         <str name="fq">inStock:true</str>
       </lst>
      -->
    <!-- "invariants" are a way of letting the Solr maintainer lock down
         the options available to Solr clients.  Any params values
         specified here are used regardless of what values may be specified
         in either the query, the "defaults", or the "appends" params.

         In this example, the facet.field and facet.query params would
         be fixed, limiting the facets clients can use.  Faceting is
         not turned on by default - but if the client does specify
         facet=true in the request, these are the only facets they
         will be able to see counts for; regardless of what other
         facet.field or facet.query params they may specify.

         NOTE: there is *absolutely* nothing a client can do to prevent these
         "invariants" values from being used, so don't use this mechanism
         unless you are sure you always want it.
